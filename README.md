Conclusion

In this lab we learned the various definitions of computer terms. We then explain the purpose of various hardware components. We explained data representation and

practiced converting decimal, binary and hexadecimal.  We explored the various components of computing such as ALU, Control Units,

hard drives, memory, CPU, Input and output and what role they function in computing. We then came up with real world examples including a grocery store purchase.

We saw how the IEEE is striving to establish international standards to science and technology.
