HARDWARE
A. Explain the difference between latency and transfer rates in performance of hard drive. 
Latency is measured in miiliseconds and is the amount of time it takes a hard drive's read/write head to find the loaction of a piece on   the disk. The rotational latency. The transfer rate if the speed at which the data is transferred to and from the disk media (disk platter). It is measured in megabytes per second. So latency is the time to find the data on the media and transfer is after it is found how long it takes to transfer from the media.

B. Explain how solid state (SSD) hard drive is different from traditional hard drive.The traditional spinning hard drive is the storage on a computer. The data on the system memory when you turn the system off. SSD solid state is a term that refers to electronic circuitry that is built entirely out of semiconductors.memory drives that plug into the USB port. The solid state drives and USB flash drives both use the same type of memory chips that retain their information even when they have no power. The difference between SSD and traditional is in the form factor and capacity of the drives. A flash drive is designed to be external to the computer system, an SSD is inside the computer in place of a more traditional hard drive.

C.Explain RAM
i. Why does RAM make the computer run faster?
The faster the RAM, the faster the processing speed. With RAM, you increase the speed at which memory transfers information to other components. Meaning, your fast processor now has an equally fast way of talking to the other components, making your computer much more efficient.

ii. What is the difference between 64 and 32 bit paths?
A 64-bit processor is more capable than a 32-bit processor, because it can handle more data at once. A 64-bit processor is capable of storing more computational values, including memory addresses, which means it’s able to access over four billion times the physical memory of a 32-bit processor.
